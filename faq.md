## Is MetriVerse only for buying and selling NFTs?
**No! MetriVerse can be used to showcase any NFTs you own on the Metrix blockchain. In addition to this, the token management tool provided can be used for most general purpose needs an NFT holder might have, like transfers and approvals.**

**MetriVerse can also be used as a way to launch your NFT project. Any projects launched through the platform have the advandage of being automatically approved for traded in the MetriVerse market.**

## Are there any hidden fees?
**No! While we cannot control the network/gas fees, MetriVerse aims to be completely transparent about any and all fees a user might incur while using the platform.**

**MetriVerse respects ERC2981 royalties and applies a 2% platform fee on the sale price of NFTs traded through the platform.**


## How do trading fees work? Are there royalties?
**On MetriVerse the token seller pays all fees and royalties. MetriVerse has a platform trading fee of 2% which is applied to the sale price. MetriVerse `BaseSale` and `SimpleAuction` contracts respect [EIP 2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981) royalties.**

**These fees and royalties are taken from the purchase price. Consider selling an NFT which has a 5% royalty on MetriVerse for 1000 MRX and a platform fee of 2%.**

| Sale Price: | 1000 MRX | |
| ---: | :---: | :---: |
|  Platform Fee   |   2%  | 20 MRX|
|  ERC2981 Royalty   |   5%  | 50 MRX|
|         Seller           |     93%   |   970 MRX    |
 

**The buyer would pay 1000 MRX for the token, 2% (20 MRX) would go to the MetriVerse platform, 5% (50 MRX) would go to the NFT royalty beneficiary and 93% (930 MRX) would go to the seller.**
