MetriVerse allows the owners of tokens to add their tokens for showcase, management and/or trading. Existing and/or external MRC721 tokens can be added on the [add existing token page](https://metriverse.exchange/app/manage/token/add)

> In order to be eligable to be used on the platform, the collection must have either been created through the platform, or if an external collection approved on the platform. See the [adding a collection guide](/developer-guides/add) for more information about how to add an existing and/or external MRC721 token collection.
