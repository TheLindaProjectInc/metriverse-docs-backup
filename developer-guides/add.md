Existing or external MRC721 token collections can only be added to the platform from the [add existing collection page](https://metriverse.exchange/app/manage/collection/add) and requires administrator approval before it is added to the system.

The process for submitting new requests is as simple as entering the contract address as well as any relevant information into the form, and submitting it.

Approved collections are approved for showcasing and/or trade on the MetriVerse platform.

> MRC721 tokens which implement [EIP 2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981) are automatically supported for royalties on sales and auctions.

> A 2% platform trading is applied to the sale price of MRC721 tokens for sale or auction on the MetriVerse platform.
