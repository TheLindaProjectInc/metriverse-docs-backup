MetriVerse exists on the Metrix blockchain as a set of contracts which are accessible outside of the platform website. 

It's possible to achieve this using a library.

<br/>

##### TypeScript/JavaScript
- [metrilib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metrixcoin/metrilib)
  - a library which can be used as a general purpose Metrix library, as well as to interact with MetriVerse core contracts.
- [mnslib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metrixnames/mnslib)
  - an update/port of ensjs made to work for the Metrix Name Service and MetrixCoin blockchain.
